# Autonomous-Line-following-Robot-
Using Arduino Uno, a 3 wheel line following robot was developed.
The robot performed the following tasks:
Follow black tape using infrared sensors.
Identify a bin/object within 1 meter using ultrasound sensor.
Distinguish the colour of the bin between green, blue and red using a colour sensor. 
Differentiate between a metal and plastic object using a halleffect sensor. 
Used constructed Mechanism using a servo motor to drop object intro correct bin. 
Robot did not go to the same bin more than once.
Performed all of the above tasks within 1 minute and 30 seconds.
